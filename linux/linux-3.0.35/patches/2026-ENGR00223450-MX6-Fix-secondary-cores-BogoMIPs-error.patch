Subject: [PATCH 2026/2508] ENGR00223450 [MX6]Fix secondary cores BogoMIPs
 error

After doing some suspend/resuem test, secondary cores BogoMIPs
will be wrong, the root cause is that when cpufreq is changed,
we only update the online cpus' loops_per_jiffy, and when secondary
cores back to online, we skip the loops_per_jiffy calibration. During
suspend/resume, the cpufreq can be changed during disabling/enabling
secondary cores, which will make secondary cores loops_per_jiffy
wrong, so here we need to update all possible cpus' loops_per_jiffy
when cpufreq is changed.
