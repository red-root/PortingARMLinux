Subject: [PATCH 2203/2508] ENGR00231910 PU regulator: do not disable PU
 regulator

If system enter suspend/resume during VPU encoding on Rigel, there will be
"VPU blocking: timeout." error . But there is ok if enter suspend/resume
during VPU decoding and enter suspend/resume during encoding/decoding  on
Arik, until now we didn't know the root cause, so revert it firstly.
Because the previous patch about PU regulator is composed with four commits
and hard to revert, now we adopt simplest way that do not disable PU regulator
in low level. The negative impact is there will several mA increasment in
suspend, we will fix it ASAP.
